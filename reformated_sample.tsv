i can hear the question already .  what on earth do these two movies have in common ?  to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors .  as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers .  but oh , how differently the packages affect their films .  while " everyone's " production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is .  i left " everyone says i love you " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face .  i left " the portrait of a lady " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less .   " everyone " features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise .  woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again .  	 positive
gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind .  he has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under .  when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one .  it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in " session 9 . "  gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there .  their guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum .  but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store .  as they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen .  gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him .  phil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend .  	 positive
devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire .  the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version .  and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results .  heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment .  outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight .  sometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) .  among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick " doogie howser " harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets .  while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from " beverly hills 90210 . "  so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ?  for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material .  	 positive
armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking .  stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up .  armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer .  but i loved every freaking minute of it .  believe me , i'm just as shocked as you are .  hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place .  the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running .  i'm sorry , but " somebody dial 911 ! ! ! "  isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie .  it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( " beam me up scotty " - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) .  	 positive
i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing " disturbing behavior " with " scream . "  maybe it's because they're both horror films ( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me .  but this is not the next in line with the " scream " flicks as well as the " i know what you did last summer " soon to be flicks .  it owes less to " halloween " and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature .  and it should have been .  this is basically a rehash of " the stepford wives , " the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i've been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives .  or something like that .   " behavior , " starring katie holmes of " dawson's creek , " deals with a bunch of teenagers , deep in angst , who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers .  suck-ups .  preppies .  	 negative
contrary to the title , " the boxer " is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics .  it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story .  all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal .  we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be .  oh well .  it's still an excellent irish story .   " the boxer " of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over .  first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail .  while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's " shallow grave " ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together .  danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again .  	 positive
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .   " quick , robin !  the anti-shark repellant ! "  - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg  i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard .  this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill .  batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss .  by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast .  the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life .  	 negative
 " pokemon 3 : the movie " has a lot of bad things in it .  first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation .  the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically .  a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million .  warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid .  this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is " pokemon : the johto journeys " so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown .  they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities .  the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants .  now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one .  too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between .  	 negative
kadosh means sacred in hebrew .  amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one .  the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government .  gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel .  the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view .  that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are .  the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel .  this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .  it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .  the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .  	 positive
a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july !  i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family .  the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based .  my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? )  i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film .  it is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture .  for those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , " a graduate of several 12-step programs . "  stuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles .  stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking .  then , disaster strikes .  	 positive
american pie 2 is filled with laughs .  but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .  i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy .  but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .  what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart .  of the original , i noted it was " a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . "  well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up .  at least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser .  fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score .  as usual nothing goes right until the last reel .  	 negative
as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window .  after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter .  from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy .  home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more  than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) .  after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there .  this movie is a lot of fun .  it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy .  the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy .  one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes .  	 positive
a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to " invent " a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " ( damon wayans ) .   ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . )  he may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film doesn't give us a reason to care .  as a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that : unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless .  as a commentary on race relations , it's even * less * effective .  the dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs ! "  writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang , though we never hear enough of it .  the script isn't strong enough , though , to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin ( house party ) .  he comes across as absolute overkill .  the great white hype * almost * turns around at the end , at the big match , when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock-concert proportions .  	 negative
sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ?  yup , it's gotta be summer .  just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed .  the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff .  sound exciting ?  dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing .

here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie .  now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is .  all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude .  van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives .  van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france .  the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death .  once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are .  jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie .  in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal .  on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked .  	 negative
talk about beating a dead horse !  when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film .  the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited .  for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber .  now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the " home alone " name as well .  the result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 .  by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest .  the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness .  he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was .  the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber .  	 negative
ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead .  bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) .  the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years .  followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) .  the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 .  the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 .  included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell .  campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film .  such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard .  also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods .  	 positive
the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy .  but after diasappointing films such as " godzilla " and " fear and loathing in las vegas " , it would be nice to see a really good film .  but i doubt you could have expected this .  the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the " decade's best " list .  there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , " yes , that's what makes this film great . "  the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically .  there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show .  it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect .  carrey has made a very wise choice .  by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side .  	 positive
for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene .  now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow's super stardom in the acclaimed 'a better tomorrow' ) by moving to hollywood .  i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them .  chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt .  his final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy .  this he refuses do and runs .  however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job .  cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations .  some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring .  the car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked .  	 negative
you don't need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy " species ii " is .  with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable .  it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction .  the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle .  the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black .  that should have been the end of the movie right there .  back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate .  on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again " played " by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing .  this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to " the dukes of hazzard " tv show , which she appears to enjoy .  eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .  	 negative
