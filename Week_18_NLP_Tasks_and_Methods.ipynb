The way the AllenNLP training loop works is that we will take the field names that you used in your `DatasetReader` and give you a batch of instances with _those same field names_ in `forward`. So, because we used `text` and `label` as our field names, we need to name our arguments to `forward` the same way.\r\n",

Each type of `Field` knows how to convert itself into a `torch.Tensor`, then create a batched `torch.Tenso`r from all of the Fields with the same name from a batch of `Instances`. The types you see for `text` and `label` are the tensors produced by `TextField` and `LabelField` (again, see our chapter on using TextFields for more information about TextFieldTensors). The important part to know is that our `TextFieldEmbedder`, which we created in the constructor, expects this type of object as input and will return an embedded tensor as output.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "### Embedding the text\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The first actual modeling operation that we do is embed the text, getting a vector for each input token. Notice here that we’re not specifying anything about `how` that operation is done, just that a `TextFieldEmbedder` that we got in our constructor is going to do it. This lets us be very flexible later, changing between various kinds of embedding methods or pretrained representations (including ELMo and BERT) without changing our model code. More on this later.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "### Applying a Seq2VecEncoder\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "After we have embedded our text, we next have to squash the sequence of vectors (one per token) into a single vector for the whole text. We do that using the `Seq2VecEncoder` that we got as a constructor argument. In order to behave properly when we’re batching pieces of text together that could have different lengths, we need to _mask_ elements in the `embedded_text` tensor that are only there due to padding. We use a utility function to get a mask from the `TextField` output, then pass that mask into the encoder.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "At the end of these lines, we have a single vector for each instance in the batch.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "### Making predictions\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The last step of our model is to take the vector for each instance in the batch and predict a label for it. Our `classifier` is a `torch.nn.Linear` layer that gives a score (commonly called a `logit`) for each possible label. We normalize those scores using a `softmax` operation to get a probability distribution over labels that we can return to a consumer of this model. For computing the loss, PyTorch has a built in function that computes the cross entropy between the logits that we predict and the true label distribution, and we use that as our loss function.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "And that’s it! This is all you need for a simple classifier. After you’ve written a `DatasetReader` and `Model`, AllenNLP takes care of the rest: connecting your input files to the dataset reader, intelligently batching together your instances and feeding them to the model, and optimizing the model’s parameters by using backprop on the loss. We go over this part in the next chapter.\r\n"
